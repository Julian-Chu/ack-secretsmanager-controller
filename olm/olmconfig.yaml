  **About Amazon Secrets Manager**


  AWS Secrets Manager helps you manage, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, application credentials, OAuth tokens, 
  API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycles. [Many AWS services that use secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/integrating.html) store them in Secrets Manager.
  
  
  Secrets Manager helps you improve your security posture, because you no longer need hard-coded credentials in application source code. 
  Storing the credentials in Secrets Manager helps avoid possible compromise by anyone who can inspect your application or the components. 
  You replace hard-coded credentials with a runtime call to the Secrets Manager service to retrieve credentials dynamically when you need them.
